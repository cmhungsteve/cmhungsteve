### Hi there üëã ![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=cmhungsteve&color=green)

My name is Min-Hung (Steve) Chen (Èô≥ÊïèÂºò in Chinese). I am a **Senior Research Scientist** at [NVIDIA Research](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/), working on ***Vision+X Multi-Modal AI***. I received my Ph.D. degree from Georgia Tech, advised by [Prof. Ghassan AlRegib](https://ghassanalregib.info/) and in collaboration with [Prof. Zsolt Kira](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~zk15/). Before joining NVIDIA, I was a *Research Engineer II* at [Microsoft Azure AI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/ai-platform), working on Cutting-edge AI Research for [Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/). Before Microsoft, I was a *Senior AI Engineer* at [MediaTek](https://www.mediatek.com/), working on Deep Learning Research for Edge-AI and Vision Transformer.

My research interest is mainly on **Learning without Fully Supervision**, including domain adaptation, continual learning, self-/semi-supervised learning, etc. In addition, I have also conducted researches on [transformer, attention](https://github.com/cmhungsteve/Awesome-Transformer-Attention), transfer learning, action segmentation, action recognition, video understanding, and temporal dynamics understanding.

**[Update]** I released a comprehensive [paper list for **Vision Transformer & Attention**](https://github.com/cmhungsteve/Awesome-Transformer-Attention) to facilitate related research. Feel free to check it (I would be appreciative if you can **‚òÖSTAR** it)!
