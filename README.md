### Hi there üëã

My name is **Min-Hung (Steve) Chen** (**Èô≥ÊïèÂºò** in Chinese). I am a **Senior AI Engineer** at [MediaTek Inc](https://www.mediatek.com/innovations/artificial-intelligence), working on **Deep Learning for Edge-AI** and **Vision Attention and Transformer**. I received my Ph.D. degree from Georgia Tech, advised by [Prof. Ghassan AlRegib](https://ghassanalregib.info/) and in collaboration with [Prof. Zsolt Kira](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~zk15/).

My research interest is mainly on **Learning without Fully Supervision**, including continual learning, self-/semi-supervised learning, federated learning, etc. In addition, I have also conducted researches on domain adaptation, transfer learning, action segmentation, action recognition, video understanding, and temporal dynamics understanding.
