### Hi there 👋 ![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=cmhungsteve&color=green)

My name is Min-Hung (Steve) Chen (陳敏弘 in Chinese). I am a **Senior Research Scientist** at [NVIDIA Research Taiwan](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/twn/), working on ***Vision+X Multi-Modal AI***. I received my Ph.D. degree from Georgia Tech, advised by [Prof. Ghassan AlRegib](https://ghassanalregib.info/) and in collaboration with [Prof. Zsolt Kira](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~zk15/). Before joining NVIDIA, I was working on Biometric Research for [Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/) as a *Research Engineer II* at [Microsoft Azure AI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/ai-platform), and was working on [Edge-AI Research](https://www.mediatek.com/technology/artificial-intelligence) as a *Senior AI Engineer* at [MediaTek](https://www.mediatek.com/), respectively.

My research interest is mainly ***Multi-Modal AI***, including Vision-Language, Video Understanding, Cross-Modal Learning, Efficient Tuning, and [Transformer](https://github.com/cmhungsteve/Awesome-Transformer-Attention). I am also interested in *Learning without Fully Supervision*, including domain adaptation, transfer learning, continual learning, X-supervised learning, etc. 

**[Update]** I released a comprehensive [paper list for **Vision Transformer & Attention**](https://github.com/cmhungsteve/Awesome-Transformer-Attention) to facilitate related research. Feel free to check it (I would be appreciative if you can **★STAR** it)!
